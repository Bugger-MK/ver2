        "With what can only be described as the *resting b*tch face *😒 look a newborn could possibly muster. 
        While most babies arrive soft and squishy😙😚, this one had an expression that could make even the nurses hesitate😐.
         Word has it, she came out practically glaring🤥, 
         like she was already disappointed in humanity and questioning her own choice to show up here😔. 
         

        Over the years, that ‘why am I surrounded by idiots’😴 expression has only refined, 
        keeping people on their best behavior (and occasionally scaring off the weak-hearted, apperantly).
        Let’s just say that smile or not, 
        she doesn’t exactly blend into the background😶. 
        But hey, she keeps everyone around her in check, one steely glance at a time😜. 
        Here’s to the girl who can silence a room with a look—and to all the people brave enough to stick around anyway!💝😑"      </p>

        "From the moment she opened her eyes, it was clear that she was no ordinary girl—she was born with a spark, 
        a unique sense of style and an effortless charisma💋🔥 that set her apart. Even as a child, 
        she was drawn to the colors, fabrics, and artistry of fashion🌈💙, 
        finding joy in putting together outfits that expressed her personality and vision. 
        Her keen eye and natural sense of style were undeniable😤; while others saw clothes, 
        she saw opportunities for creativity, transformation, and self-expression. 

        Her dream of stepping into the fashion world took root early, Although like her diaipers her dreams changed(maybe for the better😄😁), 
        but she still rocks outfits like she a model"     </p></div>
