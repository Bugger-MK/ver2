      <u><h2>Netball</h2></u>
      <p>
      She’s the kind of girl who lights up on the court, 
      especially when it comes to netball. 
      🏐 Her passion for sports and being active is undeniable—whether she’s training, 
      playing a game, or just pushing herself to new limits, 
      she’s at her happiest when she’s moving. 💪✨

      But despite her love for the game, 
      she faces a constant challenge: 
      back pain that seems to follow her every step. 
      😣 There are days when it flares up, 
      making practice harder and sometimes even keeping her on the sidelines. 
      Yet, she doesn’t let it stop her. 
      She’s learned to work with her body, 
      pacing herself and doing what she can to stay strong and resilient. 🌱

      Her determination to keep going, 
      even through the discomfort, 
      shows just how much she truly loves being active. 
      She’s not one to back down; for her, 
      every game and every moment on the court is worth it, 
      and she’ll keep finding ways to play the sport she loves. ❤️

         🥔 There's just something about their versatility that makes them 
         perfect for any meal or snack.
